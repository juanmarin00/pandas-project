# Pandas Project

In this project we had to use our newly gained skills to clean a dataset and then use this clean data to draw a hypothesis.

In my case the hypothesis wich I tried to contradict is that the hate and negative perception which sharks received after the release of the movie "JAWS" was undeserved.

In this repository you can find two jupyter notebooks:
Data_cleaning.ipynb contains all the ugly under-the-hood work which was carried out to clean the dataset
Shark_data_analysis.ipynb contains a more thorough presentation of our hypothesis the breakdown and plotting of the data and a conclusion.

Additionally Shark_clean.csv contains the cleaned data.

I hope you enjoy this project!
